Lab 1

In this lab, I created a user story map based on scheduling my semester.
 I did this by creating 3 epics in the backbone, 6 steps in the walking skeleton
 and 18 total tasks with a name, status, and a time esimate. 2 of these have
 set release dates. Some extr features that I used include a colour change for the 
 card, annotations, and details. See Lab2 Screenshot for what it looked like!
